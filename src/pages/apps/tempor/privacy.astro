  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>TemporHQ ("the App") is a time tracking application. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how the App handles your data.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All data you create in the App — including projects, time entries, and settings — is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. No data is transmitted to external servers, cloud services, or third parties.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal information. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No account creation or login is required</li>
    <li>No analytics or usage tracking</li>
    <li>No advertising or ad-related data collection</li>
    <li>No crash reporting sent to external services</li>
    <li>No cookies or web tracking technologies</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Notifications</h2>
  <p>The App uses local notifications to remind you about running timers. These notifications are processed entirely on your device and do not involve any external servers. You can disable notifications at any time through the App's settings or your device's system settings.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party services that collect or process user data.</p>

  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete all App data at any time by uninstalling the App.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date above.</p>
