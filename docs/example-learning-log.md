What you learned, what you tried, what worked or didn't.

### Second Topic

Use `##` headings as dated entries — they get styled as a timeline on the detail page.

```typescript
// Code snippets for things you're learning
const example = "include code when relevant";
```

Keep adding entries as you learn. Update the `updatedAt` date in frontmatter each time.
